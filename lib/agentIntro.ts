// Helpers for ensuring a personal agent has DM'd the user their intro
// message at least once. Used by:
//   - app/agent.tsx (post on first-time setup)
//   - app/(tabs)/chat.tsx back-fill (post on first chat-tab visit if
//     setup completed before this code shipped + intro was lost)
//
// Idempotent — only posts when the agent thread has zero agent-authored
// messages. Caller is responsible for invalidating the conversations
// cache afterwards so the Recent sidebar refetches.

import { ORG_ID } from './recursiv';

// Plain, no-possessive greeting. Earlier version templated the user's
// first name ("Hey jack, ...") but Jack's stored display name had a
// trailing 's, so the intro rendered "Hey jack's, I'm...". Generic
// greeting dodges the whole class of name-parsing bugs.

 * Ensure a personal agent's DM thread has at least one agent-authored

 * Dedup check uses the SDK's `sender` field shape (server returns
 * `sender: { id, name, is_ai }`, NOT `author`). Earlier code looked
 * at `author.id` which was always undefined — so every back-fill
 * reposted the intro. Jack's thread ended up with 4 copies.
