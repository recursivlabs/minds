// Minds AI onboarding: on first sign-in, every user gets a personal agent
// ("Minds AI") and a one-time welcome DM from it in their inbox. No opt-in
// gate — the agent is there by default and can be turned off in Settings.
//
// Design notes:
//  - Idempotent + non-clobbering. ensurePersonal is find-or-create; we only
//    apply Minds branding (name/model/prompt) when the agent is NEWLY created,
//    so a user who already customized their agent keeps their settings.
//  - Fire-and-forget from the auth flow: never block or fail sign-in on this.
//  - Welcome DM dedup lives in ensureIntroDM (posts only if the thread has zero
//    agent-authored messages), so re-running on every sign-in is safe.

import { ensureIntroDM } from './agentIntro';
import { invalidate } from './cache';

// Default Gemini for the personal agent (customer-agent default; never Sonnet).
